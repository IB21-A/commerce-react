# E-bid Front End

A simulated Ebay style site that allows users to register/login. create and edit bid listings, add items to a watchlist, bid on items that aren't their own, upload images, comment on listings, and view listing stats on their profile page.

## Rebuilt from the Ground Up

This application was rebuilt from scratch from an older version. It was previously built using vanilla Django with Django's template engine for the front end with vanilla javascript and css.

The application now utilizes a Django REST Framework API that the React front end can fetch data from. The application has been deployed as one unified project. The Django back-end and front-end build can be seen [here](https://github.com/IB21-A/ebid)

### What's Different?

- React Front-end
- Django REST API Back-end
- JWT Authentication
- Axios Instead of Fetch API
- Centralized Front-end API
- Styled Components
- Better CSS/Responsiveness
- Reusable Components

### What's Coming

- Data table on user's own profile page displaying currently active bid and whether or not they are the top bid
