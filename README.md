# E-bid Front End

A simulated Ebay style site that allows users to register/login. create and edit bid listings, add items to a watchlist, bid on items that aren't their own, upload images, comment on listings, and view listing stats on their profile page.


## Work in Progress

This application was rebuild from scratch from an old version. It was previously built using Django template engine based front end with vanilla javascript and css. Currently the profile page is still being built out on the front end.
